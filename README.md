This a simple space invaders style clone I have created using the pygame library.

Use the left and right arrow keys to control the wizard at the bottom of the screen.
Spacebar will make the wizards shoot a fireball.
Try and destroy as many ogres as you can before 1 of them reaches the bottom of the screen.

To run the game just clone the repo and execute the code in visual studio of similar coding software.

The only library used that does not come with the standard python library is pygame.
